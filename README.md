## Tasks

### [Task 1](https://github.com/Vishwachetankittali/Samsung-RISC-V-Talent-Development-Program/tree/main/task%201)
**Description:** Refer to C-based and RISC-V-based lab videos to:

- Compile C code using `gcc`.
- Compile and count the number of instructions used in `o1` and `ofast` using the RISC-V compiler.

### [Task 2](https://github.com/Vishwachetankittali/Samsung-RISC-V-Talent-Development-Program/tree/main/TASK%202)
**Description:** In this task, you will explore the compilation process for both standard C and RISC-V architecture:

- Compile a simple C program using the `gcc` compiler.
- Use the RISC-V compiler to compile the same code with optimization flags `-O1` and `-Ofast`.
- Count and compare the number of instructions generated for each optimization level, understanding the impact of compiler optimizations on RISC-V assembly code.
