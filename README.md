## Tasks

### [Task 1: Environment setup and comparing RISC-V compiler with gcc compiler](https://github.com/Vishwachetankittali/Samsung-RISC-V-Talent-Development-Program/tree/main/task%201)
**Description:** Refer to C-based and RISC-V-based lab videos to:

- Compile C code using `gcc`.
- Compile and count the number of instructions used in `o1` and `ofast` using the RISC-V compiler.

### [Task 2: Analyzing RISC-V Performance with Compiler Optimization Flags (-O1 and -Ofast)](https://github.com/Vishwachetankittali/Samsung-RISC-V-Talent-Development-Program/tree/main/TASK%202)
**Description:** In this task, you will explore the compilation process for both standard C and RISC-V architecture:

- Compile a simple C program using the `gcc` compiler.
- Use the RISC-V compiler to compile the same code with optimization flags `-O1` and `-Ofast`.
- Count and compare the number of instructions generated for each optimization level, understanding the impact of compiler optimizations on RISC-V assembly code.

### [Task 3: Decoding and Analyzing RISC-V Instruction Types and 32-Bit Patterns](https://github.com/Vishwachetankittali/Samsung-RISC-V-Talent-Development-Program/tree/main/TASK%203)  
**Description:** In this task, you will analyze and decode RISC-V assembly instructions using instruction type formats.

A. **Review RISC-V Instruction Formats:**  
   - Studying the official RISC-V software documentation to understand the following instruction types:  
     - **R-type**  
     - **I-type**  
     - **S-type**  
     - **B-type**  
     - **U-type**  
     - **J-type**  

B. **Analyze Application Code:**  
   - Use the `riscv-objdump` tool to analyze your application code.  
   - Identify 15 unique RISC-V instructions from the disassembled output.

### [Task 4: Functional Simulation of RISC-V Core](https://github.com/Vishwachetankittali/Samsung-RISC-V-Talent-Development-Program/tree/main/TASK%204) 

**Description**:  
This task involves performing a functional simulation of a given RISC-V Core Verilog netlist and testbench to verify the core's functional correctness and document the results.

 **Objectives**  
- Simulate the RISC-V Core using the provided Verilog netlist and testbench.  
- Verify the functional correctness by analyzing the output signals.  
- Document the results with waveform snapshots and upload them to GitHub.  

#### Steps  

 **1. Download Files**  
 **2. Set Up Simulation Environment**  
 **3. Run Functional Simulation**  
 **4. Capture Waveforms**  
**5. Documentation to repository**
